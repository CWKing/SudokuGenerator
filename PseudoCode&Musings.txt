Possible ways to handle the Forcing States of Potential, subfamily lock problem (ie, the FSoP case in which a subfamily of 1<K<9 cells all contain the exact same K potentials):
Since family is an abstraction of column, row, and block, we will likely proceed using some sort of template function to accept custom iterators over these things.
Need to consider what can be done to expedite this process since tackling it via a brute-force-esque method will be computationally time consuming
